# TIPE - Reed Solomon Code

Code and reports realized by me in 2017 for the TIPE (Travaux d'Initiative Personnelle Encadr√©s)  as part of the french engineering schools admission contests.


The subject I chose was the Reed Solomon error correcting code, and this repo contains the code I produced implementing said Reed Solomon code, as well as the various versions of the reports and presentations handed in for the contest (note: all those documents are written in french)
